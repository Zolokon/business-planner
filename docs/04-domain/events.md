## üéØ What are Domain Events?

**Domain Event** = Something that happened in the domain that domain experts care about

**Characteristics**:
- **Past tense naming** - TaskCreated, TaskCompleted (not CreateTask)
- **Immutable** - Event happened, cannot be changed
- **Timestamped** - When it occurred
- **Contains data** - What happened and relevant context

**Purpose**:
- Trigger side effects (send notification, update analytics)
- Enable event sourcing (audit trail)
- Decouple components (loose coupling)

---

## üìã Domain Events in Business Planner

### Event Categories

1. **Task Lifecycle Events** - Task created, updated, completed
2. **Learning Events** - Time estimation feedback
3. **Analytics Events** - Weekly reports, insights
4. **System Events** - Errors, warnings

## üîÑ Event Flow Example

### Voice-to-Task Complete Flow

```python
# 1. User sends voice message
# Telegram webhook received

# 2. Voice processing starts
voice_msg = VoiceMessageReceived(...)
await event_bus.publish(voice_msg)

# 3. LangGraph processes voice
# ... transcribe, parse, estimate ...

# 4. Task created
task = await task_repo.create(task_data)
event = TaskCreated.from_task(task, created_via="voice")
await event_bus.publish(event)

# 5. Event handlers execute (async)
# Handler 1: Generate embedding
await on_task_created_generate_embedding(event)

# Handler 2: Send confirmation
await on_task_created_send_confirmation(event)

# Handler 3: Log analytics
await on_task_created_log_analytics(event)

# 6. Voice processing complete
voice_processed = VoiceMessageProcessed(
    user_id=user_id,
    voice_duration_seconds=15,
    processing_time_ms=4500,
    transcript_length=50,
    task_created_id=task.id,
    occurred_at=datetime.now()
)
await event_bus.publish(voice_processed)

## üöÄ Event Bus Implementation

### Simple In-Memory Event Bus

        await asyncio.gather(*[
