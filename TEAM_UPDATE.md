# üë• Team Update - 2025-10-17

> **Updated team information for Business Planner project**

---

## ‚úÖ What Changed

### Before
Team information was generic and incomplete:
- Inventum: "Andrey (technician), Sergey (diagnostics)"
- Inventum Lab: "Olga (modeling), Mikhail (milling)"
- R&D: "Core founder team"
- Import & Trade: "Founder + assistants"

### After
Complete team structure with 8 specific people:

**Leadership:**
- ‚úÖ –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω - CEO (–≤—Å–µ 4 –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å–∞)
- ‚úÖ –õ–∏–∑–∞ - –ú–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç–∏–Ω–≥/SMM (–≤—Å–µ –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å—ã)

**Inventum:**
- ‚úÖ –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º - –î–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä (also R&D)
- ‚úÖ –î–∏–º–∞ - –ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä (also R&D)
- ‚úÖ –ú–∞–∫—Å—É—Ç - –í—ã–µ–∑–¥–Ω–æ–π –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä

**Inventum Lab:**
- ‚úÖ –Æ—Ä–∏–π –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á - –î–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä
- ‚úÖ –ú–∞—Ä–∏—è - CAD/CAM –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä

**R&D:**
- ‚úÖ –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º (–∏–∑ Inventum)
- ‚úÖ –î–∏–º–∞ (–∏–∑ Inventum)

**Import & Trade:**
- ‚úÖ –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ - –Æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç/–±—É—Ö–≥–∞–ª—Ç–µ—Ä

## üìä Key Insights

### Team Structure
- **Total**: 8 unique people
- **Cross-business**: 2 (–ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω, –õ–∏–∑–∞)
- **Cross-functional**: 2 (–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º, –î–∏–º–∞ work in both Inventum and R&D)
- **Single business**: 4 (–ú–∞–∫—Å—É—Ç, –Æ—Ä–∏–π –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á, –ú–∞—Ä–∏—è, –°–ª–∞–≤–∞)

### Distribution
| Business | Team Members | Count |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Leadership | –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω, –õ–∏–∑–∞ | 2 |
| Inventum | –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º, –î–∏–º–∞, –ú–∞–∫—Å—É—Ç | 3 |
| Inventum Lab | –Æ—Ä–∏–π –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á, –ú–∞—Ä–∏—è | 2 |
| R&D | –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º*, –î–∏–º–∞* | 2* |
| Import & Trade | –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ | 1 |

*\*Same people as in Inventum (cross-functional)*

## üìù Updated Files

### Core Documentation
1. ‚úÖ **START_HERE.md** - Quick context updated with team info
2. ‚úÖ **docs/00-project-brief.md** - Full brief updated
3. ‚úÖ **docs/TEAM.md** - **NEW!** Complete team documentation
4. ‚úÖ **README.md** - Contact section updated
5. ‚úÖ **planning/GETTING_STARTED.md** - User info updated

### New File Created
**`docs/TEAM.md`** - Comprehensive team documentation including:
- Full team roster with roles
- Responsibilities per person
- Cross-functional relationships
- Task assignment logic for AI
- Database schema suggestions
- Example task assignments

---

## üéØ Impact on Development

### For AI Task Assignment
The system now knows:
- ‚úÖ Specific people and their roles
- ‚úÖ Which business each person works in
- ‚úÖ Cross-functional team members
- ‚úÖ Skills and specializations
- ‚úÖ Who to suggest for specific task types

### Example AI Logic
```
Voice: "–î–∏–º–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω –ø–æ—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç—å —Ñ—Ä–µ–∑–µ—Ä"
‚Üí Assignee: –î–∏–º–∞ (–ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä Inventum)
‚Üí Business: Inventum

Voice: "–ú–∞—Ä–∏—è, —Å–º–æ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ä—É–π –∫–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∫—É"
‚Üí Assignee: –ú–∞—Ä–∏—è (CAD/CAM –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä)
‚Üí Business: Inventum Lab

Voice: "–õ–∏–∑–∞, –Ω—É–∂–µ–Ω –ø–æ—Å—Ç –¥–ª—è –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Å–æ—Ü—Å–µ—Ç–µ–π"
‚Üí Assignee: –õ–∏–∑–∞ (Marketing)
‚Üí Business: All (cross-business role)
```

## üîÑ What This Enables

### Phase 2 Features (AI Intelligence)
Now we can implement:
- ‚úÖ **Smart task assignment** - Suggest right person based on task
- ‚úÖ **Team workload tracking** - See who has how many tasks
- ‚úÖ **Cross-business collaboration** - Track –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º/–î–∏–º–∞ across businesses
- ‚úÖ **Delegation intelligence** - AI knows who can do what
- ‚úÖ **Team analytics** - Performance and workload by person

### Database Schema
Add `members` table with:
```sql
- id
- name
- role
- businesses[] (array for cross-business)
- skills[]
- is_cross_functional
```

Add to `tasks` table:
```sql
- assigned_to (FK to members)
- suggested_assignees[] (AI suggestions)
```

---

## üìã Next Steps

### For Current Phase (Phase 0 - Specifications)

When designing **Database Schema**:
- [ ] Include `members` table
- [ ] Add relationship to `tasks`
- [ ] Support array fields for cross-business

When writing **Domain Model**:
- [ ] Define Member entity
- [ ] Define assignment rules
- [ ] Document cross-functional logic

When creating **AI Prompts**:
- [ ] Add team member detection
- [ ] Include assignment suggestions
- [ ] Handle cross-business cases

## üí° Important Notes

### Cross-Functional Complexity
- **–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º** and **–î–∏–º–∞** work in 2 businesses
- Tasks can be from either Inventum or R&D
- Need to track workload across both
- RAG search should still filter by business

### Business Isolation Still Applies
- Each business context remains separate
- Team members work in specific contexts
- Cross-business people (–ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω, –õ–∏–∑–∞) see all
- But task context stays isolated by business

### For AI Assistants
When parsing voice:
1. Detect business from context
2. Identify task type
3. Suggest appropriate team member
4. Consider cross-functional roles
