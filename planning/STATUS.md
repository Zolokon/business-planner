## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

### AI Architecture
- **Tier 1 & 2**: GPT-5 Nano ($0.05/1M tokens)
  - Ultra-fast (< 1 sec)
  - 400K context window
  - Perfect for parsing and time estimation
  
- **Tier 3**: GPT-5 (standard pricing)
  - Weekly analytics only
  - Deep reasoning
  - Strategic recommendations

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Digital Ocean Droplet (Basic)
- **Cost**: ~$6/month (ultra affordable!)
- **Setup**: Docker Compose all-in-one
- **Benefits**: Full control, simple, cost-effective
- **IaC**: Terraform for reproducibility

### Development Approach
- **Methodology**: AI-First Development
- **Process**: Specifications → AI Coding → Testing
- **Benefits**: Faster, cleaner, more maintainable

## 💡 Insights & Notes

### What's Working Well
✅ Comprehensive planning prevents future issues  
✅ Clear structure makes AI coding easier  
✅ GPT-5 Nano will save significant costs  
✅ Digital Ocean simplifies deployment  

### Risks & Mitigation
⚠️ **Risk**: Specs take longer than expected  
✅ **Mitigation**: Prioritize critical specs first  

⚠️ **Risk**: GPT-5 Nano might not be available yet  
✅ **Mitigation**: Fallback to GPT-4o-mini, similar performance  

⚠️ **Risk**: Over-engineering specifications  
✅ **Mitigation**: Keep specs practical, iterate  

### Lessons Learned
- Proper planning upfront saves 10x time later
- AI-First approach requires discipline (no premature coding)
- Digital Ocean App Platform perfect for MVP
- Spec Kit approach (our custom version) works great
