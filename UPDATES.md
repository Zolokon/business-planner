### 2. **📁 Project Structure Reorganized**

**Problem**: Files scattered in root directory  
**Solution**: Clean, organized folder structure

#### New Structure:

```
planer_4/
├── README.md              # ← Stays in root (essential)
├── .gitignore             # ← Stays in root
├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md   # ← New! Structure guide
│
├── planning/              # ← NEW! All planning docs here
│   ├── PROJECT_PLAN.md
│   ├── SPEC_CHECKLIST.md
│   ├── STATUS.md
│   └── GETTING_STARTED.md
│
├── docs/                  # ← Technical documentation
│   └── [8 sections organized]
│
├── infrastructure/        # ← NEW! Reorganized IaC
│   ├── terraform/
│   ├── docker/
│   └── github/
│
└── scripts/               # ← NEW! Helper scripts
```

**Benefits:**
